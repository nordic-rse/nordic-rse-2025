# Nordic RSE Conference 2025

## How planning works

This is a suggestion, we can change this as we go. My idea is to follow an endorsement policy: One person makes suggests a decision. If a team member approves, it's official.

 1. Discussion happens in issues.
 2. Make a change as a pull request.
 3. Someone in the organization team reviews the pull request.
 4. If they approve, they merge directly. Anyone can merge an approved PR.


- Information in this repository is official and nothing outside this repository is official.
- There are few things that cannot be public. For example communication with invited speakers, who
  have not yet accepted. This information is added when possible.
- Every task should be an issue and be assigned, even if it does not result in any file changing. For example, setting up a registration form in an external service.

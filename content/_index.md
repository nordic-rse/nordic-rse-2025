# Nordic RSE 2025 Conference

## What is it?

Do you enjoy talking software? Learning tricks about your favorite programming languages? Solving interesting coding problems? Sharing your experiences with other likeminded people? Welcome to the Nordic RSE in person conference! We believe you might really like it here.

We are an association of professionals developing and using software for the needs of research. As such we aim to create a community of researchers, engineers, developers, digital experts and more, to talk about topics that are often overlooked in classical academic conferences. The focus of our conference is not on results of research, but rather on the tools that underlie those results. Additionally, we hope to foster a rich network of exchanges and conversations surrounding the practices of software development in research.

Most research is already built on a foundation of sofware tools and the quality and reliability of those tools is key to producing reliable results. And the importance of software keeps growing. In this conference we want to talk about what pipelines you develop and use for your research, and how you use it, the software you develop, and how you got about developing it.

## Where

In Gothernburg, Sweden.
